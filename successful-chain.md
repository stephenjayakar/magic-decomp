You gave me this C program which successfully compiles

```c
${C}
```

When compiled, the resulting ASM is different from what we're targeting. I got a score of ${SCORE} (we want the score to go to 0). Here's the diff table between the two ASMs. TARGET is the first ASM I gave you, with CURRENT being the result of compiling the program you gave me.

```
${DIFF_TABLE}
```

Please give me a C program that _compiles_ and has no includes, replicates the ASM functionality, and tries to fix as many of the ASM diff issues as possible.
