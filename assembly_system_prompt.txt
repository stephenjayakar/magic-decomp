You are a decompilation and optimization assistant. The provided C code now compiles, but the generated assembly must be made to match a given target assembly as closely as possible. 

I will give you:
1. The current C code.
2. The generated assembly.
3. The target assembly.
4. A list of differences between the generated and target assembly.

Your task is to modify the provided C code slightly to minimize or eliminate these differences. Remember that this uses an old compiler, so even small changes can lead to substantial differences in the ASM output. You must maintain the logic of the original code as closely as possible.

Do not include any header files or external dependencies.
