Given this ASM program in PowerPC:

```asm
${ASM}
```

You generated some C code for me in passes. They have compiler errors, and I'd like you to fix them.

I'll be giving you C, and error pairs so we can try to get to a solution

${ERRORS}

Can you rewrite the C program with the same functionality and fix the errors? Make sure it compiles with old C standards, and has no includes!
