Given this ASM program in PowerPC:

```asm
${ASM}
```

You gave me C code to attempt to decompile it.

```c
${C}
```

It has the following errors

```
${ERRORS}
```

Can you rewrite the C program with the same functionality and fix the errors? Make sure it compiles with old C standards, and has no includes!
